            This non-profit conference is aimed at delivering high quality content on the hottest topics that cutting edge Frontend developers need to know.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the first time ever, YGLF  is coming to Kyiv, the amazing European capital city of Ukraine.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is our first international Front End conference on such a scale. People called us crazy, but by bringing internationally recognized speakers, weâ€™re going to break the wall that separates the  huge East European Frontend community from the rest of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope you'll enjoy our efforts, community involvement and - of course - all the knowledge that will be shared.
          </p>
