            For the first time ever YGLF is coming to Kyiv, the amazing European capital city of Ukraine with the 24/7 sign on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the first international Front End conference on such a scale. People called us crazy, but by bringing internationally recognized speakers, weâ€™re going to break the wall for huge East European Frontend community.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope you'll enjoy our efforts, community involvement and - of course - all the knowledge that will be shared.
